# About Go packages/关于 Go packages

Everything in Go is delivered in the form of packages. A Go package is a Go source file that
begins with the package keyword followed by the name of the package. Some packages
have a structure. For example, the net package has several subdirectories, named `http` ,
`mail` , `rpc` , `smtp` , `textproto` , and `url` , which should be imported as `net/http` , `net/mail` ,
`net/rpc` , `net/smtp` , `net/textproto` , and `net/url` , respectively.

Apart from the packages of the Go standard library, there exist external packages that can
be imported using their full address and that should be downloaded before their first use.
One such example is `github.com/matryer/is` , which is stored in GitHub.

Packages are mainly used for grouping related functions, variables, and constants so that
you can transfer them easily and use them in your own Go programs. Note that apart from
the main package, Go packages are not autonomous programs and cannot be compiled into
executable files. This means that they need to be called directly or indirectly from a main
package in order to be used. As a result, if you try to execute a Go package as if it is an
autonomous program, you will be disappointed:

```sh
$ go run aPackage.go
go run: cannot run non-main package
```
