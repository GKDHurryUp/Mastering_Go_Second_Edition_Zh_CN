# About Go functions

Functions are an important element of every programming language because they allow
you to break big programs into smaller and more manageable parts. Functions must be as
independent from each other as possible and must do one job and only one job well. So, if
you find yourself writing functions that do multiple things, you might consider replacing
them with multiple functions instead.

The single most popular Go function is main() , which is used in every independent Go
program. You should already know that all function definitions begin with the func
keyword.
