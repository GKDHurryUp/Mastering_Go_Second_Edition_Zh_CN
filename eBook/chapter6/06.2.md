# About Go functions/关于Go的函数

Functions are an important element of every programming language because they allow
you to break big programs into smaller and more manageable parts. Functions must be as
independent from each other as possible and must do one job and only one job well. So, if
you find yourself writing functions that do multiple things, you might consider replacing
them with multiple functions instead.

函数是每种编程语言的一个重要元素，因为它们允许您将大型程序分解成更小、更易于管理的部分。函数必须尽可能相互独立，做且仅好一项工作即可。 因此，如果您发现自己正在编写执行多项任务的函数，您可以考虑用多个函数重构它们。

The single most popular Go function is `main()` , which is used in every independent Go
program. You should already know that all function definitions begin with the `func`
keyword.

最流行的 Go 函数是 `main()` ，它被用在每个独立的 Go 程序中。您应该已经知道所有函数定义都以 `func` 关键字开头。
