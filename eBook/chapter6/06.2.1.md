## Anonymous functions

**Anonymous functions** can be defined inline without the need for a name and they are
usually used for implementing things that require a small amount of code. In Go, a function
can return an anonymous function or take an anonymous function as one of its arguments.
Additionally, anonymous functions can be attached to Go variables. Note that anonymous
functions are also called **closures**, especially in functional programming terminology.

> It is considered good practice for anonymous functions to have a small
implementation and a local focus. If an anonymous function does not
have a local focus, then you might need to consider making it a regular
function.

When an anonymous function is suitable for a job it is extremely convenient and makes
your life easier; just do not use too many anonymous functions in your programs without
having a good reason. You will see anonymous functions in action in a while.
