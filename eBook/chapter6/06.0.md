# What You Might Not Know About Go Packages

The previous chapter talked about developing and using custom data structures like linked
lists, binary trees, and hash tables, as well as generating random numbers and difficult-to-
guess passwords in Go and performing matrix operations.

The main focus of this chapter is Go **packages**, which are the Go way of organizing,
delivering, and using code. The most common components of a Go package are functions,
which are pretty flexible in Go. Additionally, this chapter will talk about Go modules,
which are packages with versions. In the last part of this chapter, you will see some
advanced packages that belong to the Go standard library in order to better understand
that not all Go packages are created equal.

In this chapter of Mastering Go, you will learn the following topics:
- Developing functions in Go
- Anonymous functions
- Functions that return multiple values
- Giving names to the return values of a function
- Functions that return other functions
- Functions that get other functions as parameters
- Variadic functions
- Developing Go packages
- Developing and working with Go modules
- Private and public package objects
- The use of the init() function in packages
- The sophisticated `html/template` standard Go package
- The `text/template` standard package, which is another truly sophisticated Go
- package that has its own language
- The `go/scanner` , `go/parser` , and `go/token` advanced packages
- The `syscall` standard Go package, which is a low-level package that, although
- you might not use it directly, is extensively used by other Go packages
