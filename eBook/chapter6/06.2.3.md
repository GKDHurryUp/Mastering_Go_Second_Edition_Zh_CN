# 匿名函数

Anonymous functions can be defined inline without the need for a name and they are
usually used for implementing things that require a small amount of code. In Go, a function
can return an anonymous function or take an anonymous function as one of its arguments.
Additionally, anonymous functions can be attached to Go variables. Note that anonymous
functions are also called closures, especially in functional programming terminology.

> It is considered good practice for anonymous functions to have a small
implementation and a local focus. If an anonymous function does not
have a local focus, then you might need to consider making it a regular
function.

When an anonymous function is suitable for a job it is extremely convenient and makes your life easier; just do not use too many anonymous functions in your programs without having a good reason. You will see anonymous functions in action in a while.

匿名函数被定义在内部，不需要函数名，经常用它来实现一段代码量很少的功能。在Go语言中，函数能够返回一个匿名函数，或者将一个匿名函数作为函数的一个参数，此外，匿名函数能够被附加到Go变量。注意匿名函数也被称为闭包，特别是在函数式编程术语中。

> 对于一个匿名函数来说，需要实现最小的一个重点。**如果匿名函数没有重点，你就要考虑将它改造为一个常规的函数。**

当一个匿名函数只提供一个功能时，它绝对会使你的工作更加简单便捷。只是如果没有合适的场景时，不要在你的程序中使用太多的匿名函数。稍后你将会看到匿名函数的实际使用。
